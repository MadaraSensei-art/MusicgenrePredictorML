Music Genre Predictor (Machine Learning)

This project is a simple machine learning program that predicts a personâ€™s preferred music genre based on their age using a Decision Tree Classifier from Scikit-learn.

ðŸš€ Overview

The Music Genre Predictor demonstrates how an ML model can learn from example data and make predictions on new inputs.
It uses a small dataset mapping different age groups to their likely music preferences (e.g., teens â†’ Pop, adults â†’ Rock, seniors â†’ Jazz).

ðŸ§  Technologies Used

Python 3

scikit-learn (for machine learning)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

ðŸ“‚ How It Works

Dataset Creation:
A simple dataset of ages and corresponding genres is created manually.

Model Training:
A DecisionTreeClassifier is trained on this dataset.

Prediction:
The model predicts music genres for test ages and user-input ages.

Evaluation:
Displays the modelâ€™s training accuracy and a note about real-world improvement.

ðŸŽ§ Example Output

==================================================

Training the model with sample data...
Model trained successfully!
The model has learned patterns from 24 examples

==================================================
Let's predict some music preferences!
==================================================

Age 17 -> Predicted Genre: Hip-Hop
Age 25 -> Predicted Genre: Rock
Age 35 -> Predicted Genre: Rock
Age 55 -> Predicted Genre: Classic Rock
Age 68 -> Predicted Genre: Jazz

ðŸ’¡ Features
